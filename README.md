# OOP-Practice-Math-Operations-Object-Modeling
This Python program demonstrates object-oriented programming by creating classes for mathematical operations, computer specifications, and student information. It uses inheritance, class methods, and comparisons to perform calculations and manage structured data.


📘 Project Explanation

This project is designed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It includes three main parts:



🔢 1. Math Operations (Inheritance)

A base class Math stores two numbers.

Child classes (Adder, Subtractor, Mult, Divi) inherit from it and perform:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with zero-check)

The user enters two numbers, and all operations are displayed.



💻 2. Computer Objects & Comparison

Two computer objects are created with attributes like:

Owner, Processor, OS, Storage, RAM, Monitor

The program compares:

Storage size

RAM size
and prints the results using comparison operators.



🎓 3. Student Class with Getters & Setters

A Student1 class stores:

Name, Age, Group

It includes:

Getter methods to read values

Setter methods to update values

The program shows both original and updated student data.




🎯 Purpose

This project helps beginners:

Understand classes, objects, inheritance

Learn how to use methods, constructors, and comparisons

Practice clean and structured Python code
